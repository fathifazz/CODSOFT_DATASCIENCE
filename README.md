# CODSOFT_DATASCIENCE
Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

# Titanic Survival Detection Project:
The goal of this project is to predict passenger survival by analyzing the Titanic dataset. It includes activities data preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to forecast survival probabilities.

# Iris Flower Classification Project:
Using the Iris dataset, the Iris Flower Classification project uses traditional machine learning to the task of classifying iris flowers into different species according to measurements of their sepals and petals.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection Description:
In the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project addresses class imbalance, preprocesses data, and uses logistic regression for classification.
